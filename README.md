# IPMIbackup

- This is a script to automate the start and stop of servers using IPMItools in conjunction with cron jobs to automate the process.
- The cron process runs in the container. to modify, the cron Job does it on the crontab file and re-build the image.
- I automate most of the variables under the docker-compose.yml so replace the variable with your servers info before running docker-compose
- I match my START and STOP variables to match the time in the crontab file.
